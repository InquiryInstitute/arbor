- Upon fluency assessment, students discuss with other faculty over tea
- Three faculty members then issue the microcredential
- Each course creates a Matrix chat room for ongoing discussion
- Prerequisites form linear chains within each faculty (vine)
- Cross-faculty prerequisites can be added as the graph evolves
